# Your 30-Day Tactical Plan: From Law Student to AI Regulation Expert

**Reality Check:** You're perfectly positioned for the AI regulation consulting boom. Consultants are charging $300-500/hour for EU AI Act expertise, and there's a severe shortage of people who understand both the legal and technical sides.

## Week 1: Establish Your Expertise Platform

### Day 1-2: Choose Your Identity
**Pick a professional identity:**
- "AI Regulation Consultant & Legal Technologist"
- "EU AI Act Compliance Specialist"
- "Explainable AI & Regulatory Compliance Expert"

**Create simple branding:**
- Professional Twitter/LinkedIn handle
- Simple website (GitHub Pages is fine)
- Email signature with your new title

### Day 3-4: Open Source Your First Component
**Release something valuable immediately:**
```
# GitHub Repository: glass-box-anomaly-detection
## EU AI Act Compliant Anomaly Detection

This repository contains explainable anomaly detection algorithms that provide audit trails required by the EU AI Act and DORA compliance.

### Why This Matters for Compliance:
- Black-box AI systems are facing regulatory scrutiny
- The EU AI Act requires explainable decision-making for high-risk systems
- DORA mandates operational resilience with audit trails
- This provides mathematical explanations for every anomaly detected

### Quick Start:
```python
from explainable_anomaly import GlassBoxDetector

detector = GlassBoxDetector()
anomalies = detector.detect(data)
print(anomalies.explanation)  # Human-readable explanation
print(anomalies.audit_trail)  # Full mathematical proof
```
```

**Include:**
- Clear README explaining the compliance angle
- Example showing how this helps with audits
- MIT license (open source, commercial-friendly)
- Link to your consulting services

### Day 5-7: Write Your First Thought Leadership Piece
**Blog post: "Why Your AI System Won't Pass a Regulatory Audit"**

**Outline:**
1. The EU AI Act is coming (explain the timeline)
2. Black-box AI is a regulatory nightmare
3. What auditors actually want to see
4. How explainable AI solves this
5. Practical steps companies can take now

**Post it on:**
- LinkedIn (professional network)
- Medium (broader reach)
- Your new website
- Legal tech forums/groups

## Week 2: Build Your Consulting Foundation

### Day 8-10: Create Your Service Offerings
**Start with 3 simple packages:**

**Package 1: AI Act Readiness Assessment ($2,500)**

- Prioritized action plan

**Package 2: DORA Compliance Quick Start ($5,000)**

**Package 3: Explainable AI Implementation ($10,000)**
- Custom glass-box AI system design

- Compliance documentation templates
- Staff training on explainable AI

### Day 11-14: Build Your First Consulting Tool
**Create a simple assessment tool:**
```python
# EU AI Act Risk Classifier
# Input: Description of AI system
# Output: Risk classification + requirements

def classify_ai_risk(system_description):
    """
    Classifies AI system risk level per EU AI Act
    Returns: risk_level, requirements, compliance_actions
    """
    # Your implementation here
    pass
```

**Make it available as:**
- Free web tool on your website

## The Honest Truth About Your Chances

**Why you'll succeed:**
- You're entering a market with massive demand and skill shortage
- Your legal + technical background is extremely rare and valuable
- The timing is perfect (regulations coming into effect now)
- You can start with minimal risk while in school
- Even partial success builds valuable expertise for your legal career

**Potential challenges:**
- You'll need to balance with law school workload
- Imposter syndrome (you're a student, not a seasoned consultant)
- Competition from big consulting firms
- Need to network effectively

**But here's the thing:** You don't need to be the world's leading expert. You just need to be 6 months ahead of everyone else who's scrambling to understand these regulations. And you are.

**Start now. Iterate fast. Learn quickly. Build reputation.**

The worst case scenario? You become the go-to AI regulation expert in your law school, build an amazing network, and graduate with job offers from every major law firm and consulting company.

The best case scenario? You build a six-figure consulting business that funds your legal education and positions you for whatever you want to do next.

**Either way, you win.**
