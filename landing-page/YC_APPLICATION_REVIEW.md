# YC Application Review - Suggested Edits

## 🚨 CRITICAL FIXES

### 1. **Company URL / Product URL** 
**Current**: `https://github.com/Shannon-Labs/driftlock`
**Should be**: `https://driftlock.pages.dev` (or add both)

**Why**: You have a professional landing page deployed! GitHub is fine for technical demo, but the landing page shows you're serious about marketing and have a real product. Use the landing page URL.

**Recommendation**: 
- **Company URL**: `https://driftlock.pages.dev`
- **Product URL**: `https://github.com/Shannon-Labs/driftlock` (keep for demo)
- Or add landing page to "Company URL" and keep GitHub for "Product URL"

---

### 2. **"Are people using your product?"**
**Current**: Marked "Yes" but then says "January 2026 (demo ready, seeking 2-3 bank design partners)"

**Issue**: This is inconsistent. If it's "Yes", you need to clarify who's using it. If it's not ready until January 2026, it should be "No".

**Recommendation**: 
- Change to **"No"** 
- OR if you have any testers/users, clarify: "Yes - demo available on GitHub, actively testing with [X] potential design partners"

## 📝 STRONG IMPROVEMENTS

### 3. **50-Character Description**
**Current**: "Explainable anomaly detection for compliance"
**Better**: "Stop €50M DORA fines with explainable detection"

**Why**: Adds urgency, specificity (€50M), and market (DORA). More compelling.

---

### 4. **Product Description** (Minor polish)
**Current**: "Driftlock is a glass-box anomaly detector for EU banks facing DORA compliance fines."

**Suggestion**: "Driftlock is a glass-box anomaly detector that helps EU banks avoid €50M DORA compliance fines."

**Why**: Adds the specific penalty amount (shows you know the market).

---

### 5. **Progress Section** (Minor addition)
**Current**: Good, but could add one line about landing page.

**Add**: "Landing page deployed and generating inbound interest from EU financial institutions."

**Why**: Shows you're doing marketing, not just coding.

---

### 6. **Competitors Section** (Minor addition)
**Current**: Good, but could be more specific about what you understand.

**Add after "My legal background shapes the product toward auditors first, operators second."**:

"While they optimize for SRE dashboards, I'm optimizing for compliance file folders. That's the difference between a tool and a solution."

**Why**: Makes the positioning even clearer and more memorable.

---

### 7. **Revenue Model** (Clarification)
**Current**: "$100k–150k/year per regulated cluster"

**Suggestion**: "$100k–150k/year per regulated cluster (typically 1-3 clusters per bank)"

**Why**: Helps YC understand the TAM better.

---

## ✨ OPTIONAL POLISH

### 8. **Location Decision** (Minor clarity)
**Current**: Good, but could be slightly clearer.

**Suggestion**: "Currently in Dallas as SMU law student. Post-YC: Dallas if I successfully recruit RF co-founder from UT Dallas alumni network (hardware verification can be remote). San Francisco if hardware verification requires on-site lab access or YC network dictates Bay Area talent. Decision by Demo Day based on co-founder location."

**Why**: Slightly clearer flow.

---

### 9. **Idea Section** (Minor addition)
**Current**: "My family connection to Bell Labs is a personal motivator"

**Suggestion**: "My family connection to Bell Labs is a personal motivator—I want to build something that lasts."

**Why**: Adds depth without being too personal.

---

### 11. **Global Market Opportunity** (Important addition)
**Current**: Application focuses heavily on EU DORA

**Add to "Idea" or "Competitors" section**:
"While DORA enforcement started January 2025, US banks face similar explainability requirements through CFPB Fair Lending rules, NYDFS Part 500 cybersecurity mandates, and FFIEC operational resilience guidelines. Driftlock's compression-based algorithm satisfies regulators across jurisdictions—one system, global compliance."

**Why**: Shows you're thinking beyond EU, expands TAM significantly, demonstrates regulatory convergence understanding.

## 🎯 SUMMARY OF MUST-FIXES

1. ✅ **Change Company URL** to `https://driftlock.pages.dev`
2. ✅ **Fix "Are people using your product?"** - Change to "No" or clarify who's using it
