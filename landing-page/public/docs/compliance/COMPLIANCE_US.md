## Cross-Jurisdictional Compliance

Driftlock's compression-based algorithm provides mathematical proof that satisfies requirements across:
- **EU DORA**: Article 17 explainability requirements
- **US CFPB**: Fair lending explainability mandates
- **NYDFS Part 500**: Cybersecurity audit trail requirements
- **FFIEC**: Operational resilience guidelines

The same mathematical explanations (NCD scores, p-values, statistical significance) satisfy regulators across jurisdictions.
