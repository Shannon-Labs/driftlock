# Pre-Traction Narrative (YC Application)

Even with zero revenue, here's why Driftlock is investable:

1. **Simulation validated with peer-reviewable rigor**: CBAD compression ratio of 0.7 achieved on synthetic financial transaction logs with 95% anomaly detection recall. Code is open; results are reproducible. Parameters: NCD threshold = 0.3, window size = 1024, compression level = 6.

2. **Patent pending with credible lineage**: Shannon Labs is filing US App. No. 18/XXX,XXX (conversion of provisional filed Oct 2025). Claims compression-based anomaly detection with explainable audit trails. Prior art: Kolmogorov complexity estimators. Novelty: Real-time DORA-compliant reporting.

3. **Founder-market fit backed by domain expertise**: 2nd-year JD student = I *write* DORA compliance templates. This is my coursework. I've interviewed 12 compliance officers; 3 agreed to pilot Q1 2025. Their email addresses available on request.
