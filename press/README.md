## Key Messages

### About Driftlock
Driftlock is a compression-based anomaly detection (CBAD) platform that provides explainable AI for OpenTelemetry data. It uses novel mathematical compression algorithms to detect anomalies in logs, metrics, traces, and LLM I/O with zero training time.

### Value Proposition
- **Glass-box AI**: Every anomaly comes with mathematical proof and explanation
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Built for DORA, NIS2, and EU AI Act requirements
- **Zero Training**: Detect anomalies immediately without model training
- **OpenTelemetry Native**: Seamlessly integrates with existing observability stacks

## Boilerplate

### Short Boilerplate
Driftlock is a mathematical observability platform that uses compression-based anomaly detection to provide explainable AI for regulated industries. Built for compliance with DORA, NIS2, and the EU AI Act.

### Long Boilerplate
Driftlock revolutionizes anomaly detection with its novel compression-based approach that provides mathematical proofs for every detection. Unlike black-box AI systems, Driftlock offers glass-box explainability, making it ideal for regulated industries facing fines up to €200M for non-compliance. The platform processes OpenTelemetry data in real-time, detecting anomalies in logs, metrics, traces, and LLM interactions with zero training time. Founded by Shannon Labs, LLC, Driftlock is committed to bringing mathematical rigor to observability.
