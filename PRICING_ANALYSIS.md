## Competitive Analysis Summary

### Direct Observability Competitors

| Platform | Pricing Model | Entry Point | Anomaly Detection | Key Weakness |
|----------|---------------|-------------|-------------------|--------------|
| **Datadog** | $18-41/host/month | $900/month (50 hosts) | Included in Enterprise | Black-box AI, complex billing |
| **New Relic** | $0.40/GB + $99/user/month | Free 100GB/month | **Free across all tiers** | Usage costs escalate quickly |
| **Dynatrace** | $58/host/month | $2,900/month (50 hosts) | Included in Full-Stack | Most expensive option |
