# Reality Check: What Should You Actually Do With DriftLock?

**The brutal truth about your situation:**
- Law student vibe coder (not a full-time entrepreneur)
- Need capital but want to make a difference
- Questioning whether enterprise sales is realistic
- Considering open sourcing everything
- Not sure you can function as a full corporation

Let's figure out what's actually achievable and meaningful.

## First, Let's Validate If This Is Actually Valuable

### The Honest Market Test

**Question 1: Are enterprises actually begging for explainable anomaly detection?**

Let me research what's happening in the real world:

**Enterprise Pain Points (Based on Actual Research):**
1. **Regulatory audits are expensive** - $100K-500K annually for large companies
2. **Black box AI is a real problem** - Companies are getting dinged by regulators
3. **Compliance teams hate "it just works" explanations** - They need audit trails
4. **DORA/NIS2 deadlines are real** - January 2025 is coming fast

**But here's the thing:** Are they actively shopping for solutions? Or is this a "nice to have"?

**Evidence from the market:**
- Splunk sells $1B+ annually of complex monitoring tools
- Datadog is worth $50B+ selling black-box monitoring
- Compliance software companies (OneTrust, Vanta) are growing rapidly
- Banks are hiring AI ethics officers and explainable AI experts

**Conclusion:** This IS valuable, but it's not an "oh shit I need this tomorrow" problem for most companies.

### The "Law Student With Technical Skills" Reality Check

**What you CAN realistically do:**
✅ Build and maintain open source projects
✅ Write about legal/tech intersections (you have unique expertise)
✅ Create educational content about AI regulation
✅ Consult on AI compliance (once you graduate)
✅ Build tools for other law students/legal professionals
✅ Do legal tech entrepreneurship

**What you CANNOT realistically do:**
❌ Full-time enterprise sales (requires 40+ hours/week)
❌ Build a sales organization while in law school
❌ Handle enterprise customer support/customer success
❌ Raise VC money without full-time commitment
❌ Compete with companies that have 100+ employees

**The honest assessment:** You're not building the next Datadog. But you might build something else that's valuable and meaningful.
