# Alternative Pricing Strategy: Open Core + Compliance-as-a-Service

**Date:** January 2025  
**Approach:** Open Core Business Model with Outcome-Based Compliance Pricing  
**Target:** Law student entrepreneur with limited resources, values-driven mission

---

## Executive Summary

Instead of traditional enterprise subscription pricing, this strategy proposes:

1. **Open Source the Core** - Release anomaly detection algorithms under MIT/Apache license
2. **Monetize Compliance** - Charge per compliance report/audit generated
3. **Self-Serve Model** - No enterprise sales team required
4. **Outcome-Based Pricing** - Customers pay for value delivered (compliance reports), not infrastructure

**Why This Works:**
- Generates revenue immediately (no 12-18 month sales cycles)
- Aligns with your values (open source + making a difference)
- Leverages your unique legal expertise (compliance is your superpower)
- Works with limited resources (self-serve, automated)
- Builds reputation and adoption (open source = developer love)

## The Core Insight: Separate Detection from Compliance

### What You're Actually Selling

**Not selling:** Infrastructure, hosting, or monitoring tools  
**Selling:** Regulatory compliance peace of mind

Your unique value isn't the anomaly detection algorithm (though it's excellent). Your unique value is:
- Understanding DORA/NIS2/EU AI Act requirements
- Generating audit-ready compliance reports
- Providing legal-grade evidence bundles
- Explaining anomalies in regulatory language

### The Market Reality

**Developers want:** Free, open-source anomaly detection tools  
**Compliance officers want:** Audit-ready reports that satisfy regulators  
**You can provide:** Both, with different pricing models

**You're selling:** Regulatory compliance peace of mind

**Instead of:** Long enterprise sales cycles  
**You're building:** Self-serve, automated revenue

**Instead of:** Proprietary lock-in

## Updated Perspective Based on Our Discussion

After considering the VC/accelerator path and your law student constraints, this model becomes even more attractive because it:

1. **Generates immediate income** - You can start making money within weeks, not months
2. **Builds VC-ready traction** - Open source adoption + revenue looks great to investors
3. **Flexible time commitment** - You can work on this part-time while in law school
4. **Creates multiple value streams** - Code, content, consulting, community
5. **Positions you as expert** - Perfect for both consulting and future fundraising

**This isn't just a pricing strategy - it's a complete business model that fits your current reality while keeping ambitious options open.**

The consulting revenue gives you immediate cash flow. The open source adoption builds your reputation. The compliance expertise positions you for whatever path you choose - whether that's scaling this business, raising VC money, or building a legal tech empire.

**Start here, build traction, then decide how big you want to go.**
