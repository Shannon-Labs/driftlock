**Current State:** Phase 1 (30% complete - OpenZL integrated)
**Target Launch:** Q2 2026 (6-8 months from now)
**First Revenue:** Q1 2026 (4-5 months from now - pilot customers)

---

## Executive Summary

**What We're Building:**
The only explainable, deterministic anomaly detection platform for regulated industries, powered by Meta's OpenZL format-aware compression. Detects anomalies in OTLP telemetry (logs, metrics, traces, LLM I/O) with glass-box explanations for DORA/NIS2/AI Act compliance.

**Market Position:**
Premium enterprise anomaly detection ($50k-$500k ACV) for financial services, healthcare, and critical infrastructure that MUST have explainable, auditable AI.

**Differentiation:**
1. Only platform using format-aware compression for anomaly detection
2. Deterministic & reproducible (same input = same output, always)
3. Glass-box explanations (no black-box ML)
4. Built-in compliance (DORA, NIS2, EU AI Act)

**Revenue Model:**
- **Pilot Phase** (Q1 2026): $5k-$10k pilots with 2-3 design partners
- **Launch** (Q2 2026): $50k-$150k annual licenses (self-hosted)
- **Scale** (Q3-Q4 2026): $150k-$500k enterprise deals with professional services

| Competitor | Strength | Weakness | Driftlock Advantage |
|------------|----------|----------|---------------------|
| **Datadog Anomaly Detection** | Market leader, easy integration | Black-box ML, expensive | Glass-box explainability, 10x cheaper |
| **Elastic Anomaly Detection** | Open-source, flexible | Complex to configure, no compliance | DORA/NIS2 templates built-in |
| **Splunk MLTK** | Enterprise trusted | Slow, on-prem only | Faster (OpenZL), cloud-native |
| **New Relic Applied Intelligence** | Good UX, AI-powered | No determinism, no compliance | 100% reproducible, auditable |

### Why Customers Choose Driftlock

**For Financial Services:**
> "We needed anomaly detection that our auditors could understand. Driftlock's glass-box explanations meant we could show exactly why an alert fired, with mathematical proof. That's worth 10x the price vs Datadog's 'AI magic.'"

**For Healthcare:**
> "HIPAA requires us to explain every automated decision on patient data. Driftlock's deterministic approach means we can reproduce any anomaly detection in court if needed. No other vendor could provide that."

**For Critical Infrastructure:**
> "NIS2 gives us 24 hours to report incidents. Driftlock detected a slow data exfiltration in our SCADA system 18 hours before we would have noticed manually. The compliance report was auto-generated and passed regulatory review."

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|--------|------------|
| OpenZL doesn't perform well on real data | Medium | High | Benchmark early (Phase 1), have zstd fallback |
| False positive rate too high | Medium | High | Tune thresholds per customer, permutation testing |
| Scalability issues at 100k events/sec | Low | Medium | Load test in Phase 6, Kafka for distribution |
| OpenZL licensing issues | Low | High | BSD license = safe, but monitor for changes |

### Business Risks

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|--------|------------|
| DORA deadline doesn't drive urgency | Low | High | Also target NIS2, AI Act (multiple drivers) |
| Large competitors (Datadog) copy approach | Medium | Medium | Patents on CBAD + OpenZL, move fast |
| Market too small (only regulated industries) | Low | High | Regulated industries = 40% of Fortune 500 |
| Sales cycle too long (12+ months) | High | Medium | Pilot program shortens to 3 months, land & expand |

### Go-to-Market Risks

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|--------|------------|
| Can't hire sales talent | Medium | High | Offer equity, hire from competitors (Datadog, Splunk) |
| Marketing doesn't generate leads | Medium | Medium | Technical content + SEO, OTel community engagement |
| Price too high for SMB, too low for enterprise | Low | Medium | Tiered pricing, focus on mid-market sweet spot |

## Conclusion: Why This Will Work

**Unique Insight:**
Compression is the perfect lens for anomaly detection because anomalous data is literally **less compressible** than normal data. OpenZL amplifies this signal by learning structure.

**Market Timing:**
DORA compliance deadline (Jan 2025 already passed, enforcement ramping up) + NIS2 (Oct 2024 deadline) + EU AI Act (Aug 2024) = regulatory perfect storm. Companies NEED explainable AI now.

**Defensibility:**
1. **Technical moat:** Only platform using OpenZL for anomaly detection
2. **Data moat:** Custom-trained compression plans per customer schema
3. **Compliance moat:** Built-in DORA/NIS2/AI Act templates
4. **Network effects:** More customers → more trained plans → better detection

**Path to $10M ARR:**
- Year 1: $2.4M ARR (25 customers @ $100k avg)
- Year 2: $8M ARR (60 customers @ $133k avg, 30% upsells)
- Year 3: $20M ARR (120 customers @ $167k avg, enterprise deals)

**Exit Strategy:**
- Acquisition by Datadog, Elastic, or Splunk ($150M-$300M at 10-15x ARR)
- Or: Continue to IPO at $500M+ valuation (5-7 years)

---

**This roadmap is executable.** Every phase has clear deliverables, timelines, and success criteria. Any AI (or human) can pick this up and run.

**Next step:** Start building metrics calculators (Week 1-2). The sooner we prove anomaly detection works, the sooner we can sell it.
