✅ Audit-ready documentation

2/7"

### LinkedIn Post
"Excited to share DriftLock - the first open source anomaly detection platform designed specifically for regulatory compliance.

For organizations operating under DORA, NIS2, and EU AI Act regulations, traditional black-box AI systems are no longer sufficient. Regulators demand explainable systems with full audit trails.

DriftLock provides:

🔍 **Glass-Box Anomaly Detection**: Every anomaly comes with mathematical explanations that regulators can verify

📊 **Built-in Compliance**: Automatic evidence generation for DORA quarterly reports, NIS2 incident notifications, and EU AI Act audit trails

⚡ **Enterprise Ready**: High-performance Rust core with Go API server, Apache 2.0 licensed for commercial use

🌐 **OpenTelemetry Native**: Seamless integration with existing observability stacks

The platform includes:
- Compression-based anomaly detection (CBAD) algorithms
- Real-time dashboard with SSE streaming
- API for custom integrations
- Compliance reporting hooks to Shannon Labs platform

Best of all, it's completely open source. Organizations can self-host for free, with optional compliance reporting services for those who need regulatory documentation.

🔗 github.com/Shannon-Labs/driftlock

I'm particularly interested in hearing from compliance officers, DevOps teams, and anyone working in regulated industries. How are you currently handling the explainability requirements for AI systems?
