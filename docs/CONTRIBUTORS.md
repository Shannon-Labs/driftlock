## AI-Assisted Development
This repository utilized AI coding assistants (Claude, Gemini Code Assist) for approximately 40% of initial code generation. All AI-generated code was:
- Reviewed and refactored by the founder for correctness
- Validated against compliance requirements (DORA/NIS2/EU AI Act)
- Integrated into the architecture by human design decisions

**Academic Defense**: AI usage is documented to maintain reproducibility. Core algorithms (CBAD) were human-designed; AI accelerated implementation.
